Dear Mr. Muller,

I am writing to inform you about a recent issue with our forklift.

The forklift is barely operational. When we try to move it forward, it moves, but extremely slowly.
When we attempt to move it backward, it moves faster than forward but only in "impulses." Additionally, the lift is not working at all.

Please visit us as soon as possible to address these issues.

Thank you,

RUC0066

5) The machine is making strange noises that it has not been making before.
